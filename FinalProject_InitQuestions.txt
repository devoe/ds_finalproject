Complete project question and dataset (due by 09.07). Create a GitHub repository for your project. It should include a short write-up that answers these questions:

    What is the question you hope to answer?
    
        Can we use the language of forum members to predict future behavior? Can we predict by
        the type of language/actions people take on the forum who will cause problems or need to be
        banned? Can we predict what type of people tend to donate or volunteer more to keep the forum 
        running by looking at language? Is there behavior on a forum that can help administrators 
        identify positive or negative 
        forum members?
        
        
    What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
    
        A friend of mine created and was an admin for a very popular local Los Angeles 
        electronic music forum. He has the entire site stored in a database. I would like
        to use old posts to determine if the language/actions in the posts can help identify 
        most likely what type of forum member the user would be. 
        
    What do you know about the data so far?
        
        In the brief conversation that I had with my friend I just found out the data is stored in a 
        database. He has all of the old posts, messages, admin actions stored as well. Not really 
        sure about anything more.
        
    Why did you choose this topic?
        
        The database was readily available to me. I feel like being able to predict future behavior from 
        current language and actions would be a valuable assest to forum administrators. I'm not 
        really sure how the data is stored in the database, so learning to clean the data would provide me
        a great challenge. Getting more practice using classifier models is also a plus here.
